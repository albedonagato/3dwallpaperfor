For Partial ACATS request a new transfer request would need to be submitted to bring over residuals. The sweep option for new accounts opened by existing clients starting Friday the week before transfer weekend will default to the Cash Balance Program until the transfer is complete. Therefore you can expect your remaining dividends to be swept over in the next residual sweep as long as you requested a full TOA.

**Cool zidane wallpaper**. A Fidelity rep told me that I dont need to do another ACAT to get the remaining balance over to Fidelity. You dont need to take any action to initiate these residual sweeps. Residual sweeps are typically processed within 30 days of the ACAT transfer.
